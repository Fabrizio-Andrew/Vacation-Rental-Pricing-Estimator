E-14 10-04-2021 Meeting Notes

- Graphing or visualization makes Zona happy. What we predict in a time series.
- 1 or 2 models that returns 1 or 2 numbers.
- 2 function calls to 2 models of a daily suggested price and try to put it on a page.
- 1 page takes the attributes and feed it into a page.
- Simple templated - rossmann example.
- Zona sent the solution to rossmann this morning in the Tutorials
- We should use a db so we can talk about it.
- Get familiar with this web app.
- Create our own single page web app
- Create it on heroku
- Use this as a template for our project.
- Flask, endpoints that the page uses.
- Uses and Predicts are the endpoints
- Get an MVP together so we can see the front end.
- Use Heroku first, and if it won't work, try something else.
- Run some training on some data.
- Gabe reviewed Jing's notebook
- He likes it, and it's read only.
- Have him add remarks to the notebook.
- It uploaded in GitHub. Put in the GitHub link.
- get the raw file name and it runs it for you.
- Try Jupyter - binder starts a jupyter notebook for you
- jupyter lab he highly recommends to use it.
- We can download this and test notebooks locally.
- https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-desktop-app-now-available-b8b661b17e9a
- Need Jing to explain this to us.
- Gabe says - Good variables, excellent work. Jing is building his understanding to build the model.
- Gabe says Jing is displaying the data but has not built the model.
- Why is he dropping null columns and is that going to impact our statistics or is this enough data for our training.
- Reason with the data. Add some comments, otherwise it looks good, try to play with Rossmann and start to fill up the repo.
- Gabe uses Github desktop. 
- Zona to talk about how to train our data in an upcoming lecture
- Her solution tells us how the data get trained
- Gabe to give us a script how to create the Rossmann app.
- Copy paste that structure into our GitHub.
- Then iterate with the same files.
- Gabe asks - Who is to be the db person?
- Gabe says - Train the model and use the pickle file to train the app. Feed our model from the db.
