# Vacation Rental Pricing Estimator

Property owners renting out on a short-term basis (hosts) often have little experience in the real estate or hospitality industries and lack the ability to accurately predict the fair market value of their short term rental.  AirBnB offers a pricing estimator, but it can often be inaccurate.

The Vacation Rental Pricing Estimator will provide hosts with an accurate prediction of the fair market value of their short-term rental based on location, property features, date, and any other predictors that the team finds to be meaningful.  We have identified at least two third-party AirBnB datasets that meet these criteria.  Armed with this information, hosts will be better prepared to accurately price their short-term rentals.
